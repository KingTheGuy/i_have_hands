____
Carry a storage block/node without breaking it.
you can carry a chest, a barrel.. just about anything that has an inventory.

**how?**

_Hold `sneak` then `right_click(place button)` with an `empty_hand` to pickup/place down the storage containers_

**NOTE**: does not work with *mineclonia*, they are completely overriding the *hand(easy fix on their end). **(does work with voxelibre/mineclone2)**
